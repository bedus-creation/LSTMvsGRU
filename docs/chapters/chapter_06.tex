In the study, two models, one with LSTM cell and another with GRU is trained on Bitcoin datasets from 29 April 2013 to 27 Feb 2021. Total data of 2862 is split into test, train and validation set and trained data on various look-back period. From the above studies, it can conclude that 1) GRU trains relatively faster than LSTM models on this datasets 2) There is mix performance of LSTM and GRU regarding to the RMSE and MAE results.

For future work, social media sentiments as well as financial news sentiments can be explored regarding in future studies. Different architecture and initializers could be explored for each cell type.
